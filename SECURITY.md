# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any **MyoRatio** repository, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use any of the [private contact addresses](https://github.com/FlorentinTh/MyoRatio-API#support).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

If you have a fix, that is most welcome, please attach or summarize it in your message!

We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
